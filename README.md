# Firebase Authentication Practice

This is a practice project that demonstrates how to implement Firebase Authentication using the Google and Facebook providers. Firebase Authentication is a powerful and easy-to-use service that allows you to authenticate users with email addresses and passwords, as well as with third-party identity providers like Google, Facebook, and others.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to create a Firebase project and configure authentication providers for your project. Here are the general steps:

1. Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console (if you haven't already).
2. Go to the Authentication section of the Firebase console.
3. Enable the Google and Facebook authentication providers and follow the instructions to configure each provider.
4. Install the Firebase SDK and Firebase Authentication SDK in your project. You can use a package manager like npm or yarn to install the SDKs.
5. Initialize Firebase in your app by calling firebase.initializeApp() with your Firebase project configuration.
6. Implement the Google and Facebook authentication flows in your app using the Firebase Authentication SDK.

For more detailed instructions on how to set up Firebase Authentication with Google and Facebook providers, check out the Firebase documentation:
